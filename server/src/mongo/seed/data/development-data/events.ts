    In this session, join Becca Badger for an adventure on Cambourne Nature Reserve. There'll be a selection of resources and ideas to choose from; we might make something from clay, create sculptures with sticks, take creative photos, make up songs, or even perform a play.

    This session is perfect for families with primary-aged children but older and younger siblings will enjoy them. We will adapt with the group, but please note that there are Little Bugs sessions available which are more appropriate for pre-school children.

    Adults and siblings under 18 months who are accompanying a paid-for child are free
    There are no toilet facilities available for this session. The closest public toilets are at Morrison’s nearby.`
